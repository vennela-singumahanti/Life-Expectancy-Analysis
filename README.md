The dataset used contains information on different countries and their corresponding life expectancy, adult mortality, infant deaths, alcohol consumption, hepatitis B vaccination coverage, GDP, population, and schooling.

The goal of this analysis is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the life expectancy of men/women based on these factors.By understanding the important factors that contribute to life expectancy, we can gain insights into public health and identify potential areas for intervention and improvement.

The notebook will cover the following steps:

1.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the dataset, analyzing distributions, correlations, and identifying any data preprocessing steps required.

2.Data Preparation: Preprocessing the data, handling missing values, and transforming categorical variables if necessary.

3.Feature Selection: Selecting relevant features for the prediction task.

4.Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

5.Conclusion: Summarizing the findings and discussing potential insights gained from the analysis.

Based on the analysis and modeling performed, several insights have been gained regarding the factors influencing life expectancy for men. The selected features, including adult mortality, infant deaths, alcohol consumption, hepatitis B vaccination coverage, GDP, population, and schooling, have shown significant correlations with life expectancy
